		<h1>This is project 2</h1>
		<h2>This is what I did in my second half of intership. </h2>
		<p>
			This is a mobile application based project.
			Main Issue: the interaction design on our previous demo app was not good. Our potencial consumer always asked about how to navigate through this app. We also want to update more show caes on this app to demo our abilities to potential consumers.
			Solution: We were creating the new version of app based on the old version. Becasue the old one does not have very good functionality. And it does not include accessbility either.
